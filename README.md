# legislator CLI

**legislator** is an CLI for managing Kubernetes Network Policies from a single config file. Like a member
of a legislative body, the legislator CLI can create rules or laws for network traffic in a kubernetes cluster.
The added value of this tool is the less complex level of defining multiple network policies for kubernetes and
the aspect of less manual configuration. 

Various use cases could be made more pleasant:
* general network segmentation in kubernetes
* pod or namespace access restrictons 
* user access restrictions
* creating development environments
* network security apsetcs for layered architectures
* public/private networking
